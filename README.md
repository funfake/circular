# Circular

**Closing the loop from tasks to delivery.**  
Circular is an AI-driven agent that connects Jira and GitHub to fully automate the path from task creation to code delivery.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Automatically fetches tasks from **Jira**
- Understands task requirements and context
- Generates and tests code changes in a sandbox
- Opens Pull Requests in **GitHub**
- Updates Jira task status to **Done âœ…**
- Creates a complete automation loop: **Task â†’ PR â†’ Done**

---

## ðŸ›  Initial Configuration

To get started, the IT team needs to:

1. Add our GitHub bot (`Circular-bot`) to the company account  
2. Provide a Jira access key  
3. Configure GitHub & Jira project repositories  

Once this one-time setup is done, Circular runs automatically.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Qualifying Tickets

Circular is designed to handle tasks that are:

- **Well-defined** â†’ clear description of expected changes  
- **Atomic** â†’ small and focused (e.g., bug fix, function update)  
- **Code-related** â†’ bug fixes, small features, config changes  
- **Testable** â†’ tasks with clear success criteria  

---

## ðŸš« Non-Qualifying Tickets

Circular is **not** designed for:

- Large epics or undefined multi-sprint work  
- Ambiguous requirements without acceptance criteria  
- Non-code tasks (design, documentation, meetings)  
- High-risk changes (core business logic, database migrations, production-critical systems)

## ðŸ“¸ Demo

[Insert screenshots or GIFs here]  
- Jira â†’ New Task  
- Circular Dashboard â†’ Task picked up  
- GitHub â†’ Auto-generated PR  
- Jira â†’ Status updated to Done

## ðŸ”® Vision

Future improvements:

- Automated testing & deployment  
- Support for more platforms (Trello, Asana, ClickUp)  
- Complex task decomposition with multi-agent collaboration

# Next.js, WorkOS, Convex, Shadcn/ui starter kit

This is a starter kit already configured to start working on your side project ðŸš€

## Guides
- Next.js starter guide: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation
- Convex + WorkOS guide: https://docs.convex.dev/auth/authkit
- Shacn/ui with Next.js https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next

## Start the development server
Start with `yarn install` (to install package) and then run the development server `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Start Convex
Run the commant `npx convex dev` (after having configured the project, see below).

# Configuration
## WorkOS config
Setup AuthKit (https://dashboard.workos.com/environment/authentication)

Then follow these steps:
1. Add `Work OS Client Id` to the JWT token (see Convex + WorkOS tutorial) https://dashboard.workos.com/environment/authentication/edit-jwt-template
2. Set the CORS config (https://dashboard.workos.com/environment/authentication/sessions) to the development url `https://localhost:3000` 
3. Set the homepage url (https://dashboard.workos.com/redirects) to `https://localhost:3000`
4. Set the redirect url (https://dashboard.workos.com/redirects) to `https://localhost:3000/callback`

## Environment Config
Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project.

### Create a session password for WorkOS
The SDK requires you to set a strong password to encrypt cookies. This password must be 32 characters long. You can generate a secure password by using the 1Password generator or the openssl library via the command line:
`openssl rand -base64 32`

### Add variables to `.env.local`
`WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`: From WorkOS (https://dashboard.workos.com/api-keys)
`WORKOS_API_KEY`: From WorkOS (https://dashboard.workos.com/api-keys)
`WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD`: Add the generated session password string in its entirety (with =)

## Convex config
Set `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` in Convex (project settings page)

## Fonts
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
